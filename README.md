## Description
This Whiteboard/Drawing application was developed over the course of only a few days for the November 2021 MintBean.io JR Web Developer Hackathon.

The idea for this project was presented by MintBean.io, but the specifics were left to the developer.

I decided to do a dry erase/whiteboard style project allowing the user to freehand drawings on their screen using their mouse. The user will be allowed to choose four colors to use for thier drawings by clicking on the markers shown on screen. The eraser will allow the user to erase parts of their drawing while the 'clear' button will reset the entire whiteboard to blank. Although the application is simple in nature, the functionality is dependable and useable.

## Future Updates
With this projected completed in a few short days as part of a week long hackathon, there are plenty of things I wish to update for the future.
Listed below are the planned and wishlist updates for the app:
  1. Allow the user to select to create a shape: Squares, Circles, Triangles, Hexagons, etc.
    - This would allow the user to create perfect shapes for diagrams and drawings.
  2. Allow the user to choose drawing stroke style and size.
    - This would allow the user to choose an angled marker, fine tip, or brush style to add further detail to their work. The stroke size option would allow for greater detail         or more broad lines.
  3. Built in Save and Load functions to allow the user to not only save their work but to be able to upload past work to continue working on it or a new file of a supported          file type (jpg, gif, png, etc).
  4. Different cursor styles for better user experience.
    - Create different cursor styles depending on what type of stroke the user desides to use in order to reduce confusion and expecting the user to remember what stroke style         they selected.
